CSS
-----
Cascading Style Sheets is used to describe the look and formatting of a document written in markup Language. 

Why CSS?
-------------
1. Reusability
2. Saves a lot of time
3. Provide more attributes

CSS syntax:
---------------
A CSS rule set contains a "selector" and a "declaration block".

syntax:-

selector
{
	propertyname:value,
	propertyname:value,
	....
}

h1	->	selector
	Selector indicates the HTML element you want to style. It could be any tag like <h1>,<title> etc.

propertyname:value		->	declaration block
	The declaration block can contain one or more declarations separated by a semicolon. 
		
	A property is a type of attribute of HTML element. It could be color, border etc.
	value: values are assigned to CSS properties. 

CSS Selector:-
-----------------
CSS Selectors are used to select the content you want to style. Selectors are the part of CSS rule set. CSS selectors select HTML elements according to its id,class,type,attribute etc.

5 types
1. Element Selector
	The element selector selects the HTML element by name.

2. Id Selector
	selects the id attribute of an HTML element to select a specific element. id is always unique within the page. To choose a single unique element.

It is written with the hash character (#), followed by the id of the element.

3. Class Selector
	selects HTML elements with a specific class attribute. It is used with a period character (.) followed by the classname. classnames shouldnot start with a number. 	

4. Universal Selector
	used as a wildcard character (*). It selects all the elements on the pages.

5. Group Selector
	It is used to select all the elemnts with the same style definitions. Commas are used to separate each selector in grouping. To minimize the code.

Color Codes:-
----------------
white	-	#ffffff
red	-	#ff0000
green	-	#00ff00
blue	-	#0000ff
yellow	-	#ffff00
cyan	-	#00ffff
meganta	-	#ff00ff
black	-	#000000


types of CSS:-
----------------
1. Inline CSS	
	used to apply CSS on a single line or element.
	syntax:-
		<tagname style="attribute1:value1">.....</tagname>

Disadvantages:
		These Styles cannot be reused anywhere else.
		These styles are tough to be edited because they are not stored at single place.				not possible to style pseudo-codes and pseudo-classes with inline css.
			
2. Internal CSS
	used to add a unique style for a single document. It is defined in <head> section of the HTML page inside the <style> tag.
	<head>
		<style>
			tagname1
			{
				....
				....
				....
			}
			tagname2
			{
				....
				....
				....
			}
		</style>
	</head>
	

3. External CSS
